CS3715 - Assignment #2 - Question 1:

The GET and POST methods, sometimes referred to as verbs, are two methods that
are supported by the HTTP protocol. The main difference between the two methods
is that POST unlike GET allows for the length of data being sent to be of an
arbitrary length. That is, while GET sends only the url and headers to the
server, POST also sends data via a message body. On the server side it is
recommended that requests sent via the GET method not change any data; the GET
method should only be used to read data. The POST method should be used for
other "un-safe" operations, such as the creation, deletion or modification of
data.
