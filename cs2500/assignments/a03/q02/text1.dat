 Smith talked to Vygotsky, who was in collusion with 
 Anderson, at 2120 and Vygotsky claimed Anderson was 
 en route to Havana (Anderson actually being in a 
 car by the embassy, 100 yards from Smith). Vygotsky 
 claimed that Smithson was a double agent, which 
 suprised Smith greatly as it contradicted Jensen's
 last report from Budapest. The call ended at 2129, 
 with an agreement to contact again on Wednesday as 
 a prelude to discussing Jensen-Klein's upcoming meeting 
 with Anderson in Havana on Friday.
