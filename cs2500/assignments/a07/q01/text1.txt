Excuse me, sir. Are you walking to Chelsea?
No, I am not walking to Chelsea, I am sailing there.
Are you being served?
Your sheep are looking very well this fine afternoon.
I will be taking my mayo and Parma cheese dip to the party.
Pass the salt, please.
Yes, thank you, being from California, I am most fond of avocadoes.
Are your hamburgers any good? How about your hot dogs, then?
Oddly enough, there are no fins on my carp.
Please direct me to the nearest washroom.
Is that hat there actually Gucci?
Has anyone seen my treasure map?
