				I tried to implement all the bonus features I could and I believe the only additional features
				I did not implement are the undo last operations and the internally stored quantities. These
				features however are not needed in the way the calculator is designed. Although you can not
				undo the last operation you can retrieve the previous result using the result history. The
				result history can also be used to store values by simply inputting a value and hitting enter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing to note is that when looking at the source code things may seem more complicated
				then they need be. This is generally true, as the code is written to be dynamic. I started
				writing this code with the purpose of
				adding a feature where the user of the calculator, if they had knowledge of Python, could write
				their own mathematical functions and add them to the calculator. I didn't have time to add
				this feature but it wouldn't take long to add it.
			</p>

		<div class='title'>The Source Files</div>
		<div class='body'>
			<p>
				In reading the source for this application I would suggest reading them in the order provided
				below to ensure your not reading code that is referencing code yet unread.
			<p>
			<div class='title'>CalcWidgets.py</div>
			<p>
				I wrote all the buttons in the calculator in groups. This file contains all the GUI megawidgets
				that are used in the calculator. Mostly they are just groups of buttons that when clicked generate
				a virtual event that can be later captured in the main application. The only exception to this is
				the display which is only used for display purposes only. All key bindings are also  done within
				this file. I decided to generate virtual events in place of using callback functions because I
				found the callbacks were added a lot of bulk to the application.
			</p>
			<div class='title'>CalcFunctions.py</div>
			<p>
				A very small file containing several mathematical functions that are used by the calculator to
				calculate a result.
			</p>
			<div class='title'>History.py</div>
			<p>
				This file contains a class that handles the storing and iteration of histories. The standard
				iterator in Python doesn't allow backwards iteration and I needed a way to have the iterative
				index to start at -1 for the purpose of displaying the current value. The History class also
				stores the current input when the history is being iterated. 
			</p>
			<div class='title'>Number.py</div>
			<p>
				If I had my time back I would have called this class NumericalInput. The Number class allows
				for the creation of a valid number one character at a time. The class stops there being two 
				decimals in a given input, no decimal in the exponent part and handles unary minus. This
				class will always produce a string that is valid for parsing by both Decimal and Float.
			</p>
			<div class='title'>CalculatorValues.py</div>
			<p>
				Certain functions (the Log function for example) take multiple user inputs. The class contained
				within the CalculatorValues.py file allows for easy creation, manipulation and accessing of these
				values. It assures the data is always in the correct type, makes sure there is always at least
				one value in its internal list and provides iteration over the list of values.
			</p>
			<div class='title'>Calculator.py</div>
			<p>
				This file is the heart of the calculator. It contains all the necessary functions to handle user
				input, storing and retrieving histories, function argument handling, calculating both functional
				operational operations and formatting and displaying of the input and result.
			</p>
			<div class='title'>addmachGUI.py</div>
			<p>
				The various calculator classes are useless if the user doesn't have a way to interact with them.
				The addmachGUI.py file creates a user interface and links the virtual events from the megawidgets
				to their corresponding methods in the calculator class.  
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class='title'>Additions I Would Like to Make But Didn't Have Time</div>
		<div class='body'>
			<p>
				Below are some ideas that I though of while doing this assignment that I would really like to add.
				In brackets is the particular class file in which the additions would go. The main reason I did
				not add these was I didn't feel I had adequate time to fully test these to my satisfaction.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Proper clear and delete when history is involved (Calculator.py)</li>
				<li>Editable history entries (Calculator.py)</li>
				<li>Implement reverse polish notation (Calculator.py)</li>
				<li>Implement user created functions (New)</li>
				<li>Dynamically get the number of arguments for a function (Calculator.py)</li>
				<li>Optional arguments on functions (Calculator.py)</li>
				<li>Unlimited argument functions (Calculator.py)</li>
				<li>Better handling of named constants (Calculator.py, CalculatorValues.py)</li>
			</ul>
