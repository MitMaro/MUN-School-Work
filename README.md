Tim Oram's Memorial University Code Repository
==============================================

Information
-----------

This repository contains most of the programming assignments, projects and labs
I have worked on while going to school at MUN. I make no guarantee that any of
this code is working, nor that everything on here is correct.

Why Put This Online
-------------------

I worked hard on these various assignments, projects and labs over the years
and I really hope that my hard work may be able to help others working on a
computer science degree at MUN and possibly those outside of MUN.

Warning
-------

I really do hope that my code can help someone who is stuck on an assignment.
However, __DO NOT__ use my code directly as your assignment, this is
plagiarism, is not allowed at MUN and if I discover you have done so I will
report the incident to your professor.
