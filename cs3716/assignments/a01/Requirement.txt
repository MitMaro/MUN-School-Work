Project Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A movie-goer wants to know what movies to see and which to avoid. They can do 
this by viewing movie recommendations. The movie-goer would also like to see the 
recommendation of a particular movie. The system should help the movie-goer list 
all recommendations and view a particular movie recommendation.

The movie recommendation system would allow a user to load one or more 
recommendation lists from the file system, list the lists that are loaded and 
add those lists to a master list of movie recommendations. The user can then 
display the movie recommendations from a list or display the recommendations 
from the master list. When displaying the list the user has the option to sort 
the displayed recommendation by title and then by year. The movie 
recommendations can be searched and displayed by exact name and year of a movie.
