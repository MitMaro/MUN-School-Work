Compiling
-----------------------------------------------------------------
For convenience the project can be compiled using an ant script.
Compile by using the `ant` command. Compiled classes will be
placed into the 'build' directory and a jar file will be created in
the project directory.

There is really no reason to compile the project as a jar has been
provided.


Running
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There are two interfaces available for this program. The first is
a command line only interface. To run the command line interface
simply run the command `java -jar LDB.jar`. For second interface
is a graphical interface and can be run using the following
command `java -jar LDB.jar -gui`.

GUI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The GUI recreates every aspect of the command line interface plus
provides a few additional features.

Change Log
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed critical bug in the persistence code. Empty data lists
   were completely breaking the system.
 * Refactored Application class to not use as many lists and as
   such use less memory.
 * Added a GUI option. Usable by passing -gui argument.
 * Fixed bug in Paper when using HashSets by adding hashCode()
   method.
 * Fixed a persistence bug with hashsets and serialization.
